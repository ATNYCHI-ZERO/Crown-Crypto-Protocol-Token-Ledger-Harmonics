License Considerations for Crown Crypto Protocol

The Crown Crypto Protocol is an open cryptographic financial protocol (with open smart-contract code and mathematical models). Its license must protect the author’s rights while allowing broad open-source use, including commercial/academic adoption, and guard against uncredited forks and patent threats. We compare major licenses on these criteria:

MIT/BSD (permissive) – Very permissive, minimal restrictions: Reusers need only include the copyright and license notice
en.wikipedia.org
. These licenses maximize reuse (even in proprietary software)
en.wikipedia.org
 and are highly compatible with any project. However, they offer no explicit patent license (so contributors’ patents aren’t granted)
fossa.com
. They do disclaim warranties and liability (the “AS‑IS” clause)
en.wikipedia.org
, but provide only basic attribution (no requirement to publish modifications). In practice MIT/BSD offer excellent flexibility and adoption, but limited legal protection (no patent grant, only minimal credit enforcement).

Apache 2.0 (permissive with patent grant) – Permissive with strong protections: Apache 2.0 allows anyone to use, modify, distribute and even re-license the code (including in proprietary software)
fossa.com
. Crucially, it includes an explicit patent license and termination clause
apache.org
, so any contributor grants patent rights to downstream users (and will lose them if they sue)
apache.org
. Apache also requires preserving copyright, license and NOTICE files in distributions
apache.org
, ensuring proper attribution, and disclaims warranty/liability
apache.org
. The ASF and others recommend Apache 2.0 for substantial projects because it “prevents patent treachery”
gnu.org
. In summary, Apache 2.0 combines legal safeguards (patent grant, clear terms) with broad openness, and is widely used in industry and academia
fossa.com
.

GPL v3 (strong copyleft) – Viral copyleft, strong patent terms: GPLv3 mandates that any distributed derivative or combined work be licensed under GPLv3 as well (no sublicensing)
github.com
. This ensures all improvements stay open and credit flows back, protecting authors from uncredited proprietary forks. GPLv3 also includes an implicit patent license (contributors grant patents) and prohibits tivoization or patent deals that undermine freedom
gnu.org
. However, its stringent copyleft can deter some commercial uses (companies may avoid GPL if they can’t open-source their own code). GPLv3 is academically acceptable but less “business-friendly.”

AGPL v3 (network copyleft) – GPLv3 + network use clause: AGPLv3 has all of GPLv3’s terms, plus if the software is used to provide a networked service, the modified source must be offered to users
choosealicense.com
openzeppelin.com
. This closes the “SaaS loophole” – e.g. if Crown Crypto Protocol runs on servers or blockchain nodes, any changes must be published. AGPL provides maximum openness, but is very restrictive: many companies shun AGPL because it forces open-sourcing even server-side use. It does include a patent grant like GPLv3, and explicitly ensures transparency for end-users
choosealicense.com
openzeppelin.com
, but at the cost of commercial flexibility.

MPL 2.0 (weak copyleft) – File-level copyleft with patents: As a compromise, MPL requires that modifications to MPL-licensed files be shared under MPL, but allows linking with proprietary code
fossa.com
. It includes an explicit patent grant
fossa.com
, disclaims liability, and only requires preserving copyright and license notices. MPL offers more protection than MIT (patents, attribution) while preserving some flexibility (non-MPL files can be closed)
fossa.com
fossa.com
. It’s less common but worth noting as a middle ground.

BSD 3‑Clause – Similar to MIT, with a clause forbidding use of authors’ names for endorsement. It shares MIT’s attributes (permissive, minimal obligations)
gnu.org
 and likewise lacks patent terms. FSF notes Apache 2.0 is preferable to BSD-style licenses when patent issues matter
gnu.org
.

Summary of how licenses match criteria:

Author’s protection: Apache 2.0 and GPLv3 explicitly protect authors via patent clauses and require preserving notices
apache.org
github.com
. MIT/BSD and MPL rely on copyright notices only.

Open-use flexibility: MIT, BSD, and Apache are highly flexible; GPL/AGPL enforce copyleft (less flexible for integration). MPL is middle-ground.

Commercial/Academic use: All allow such use, but GPL/AGPL impose distribution obligations that some businesses avoid. Apache/MIT are industry-favored
fossa.com
.

Attribution/derivative controls: All OSI licenses require preserving copyright notices. GPL/AGPL force derivatives to remain open
github.com
, preventing “silent forks.” Apache mandates inclusion of NOTICE text
apache.org
. MIT/BSD only require license copy
en.wikipedia.org
.

Patent protection: Apache 2.0 (sections 3) and GPLv3/AGPLv3 provide clear patent licenses
apache.org
gnu.org
. MPL 2.0 also grants patents
fossa.com
. MIT/BSD do not explicitly grant patent rights (risking “patent ambush” of users).

Recommendation: Apache License 2.0

Given these factors, Apache License 2.0 best meets Crown Crypto Protocol’s needs. It is OSI‑approved and widely trusted, and it balances permissive use with strong protections:

Patent safety: Apache 2.0 includes an explicit, perpetual patent license from each contributor
apache.org
, so downstream users (including companies) are protected from patent litigation by contributors. This greatly enhances legal security for a crypto protocol that may involve novel algorithms.

Broad adoption: Apache’s permissive nature encourages commercial and academic adoption (even in proprietary projects)
fossa.com
. Companies in finance or blockchain are comfortable with Apache’s terms.

Attribution and credit: It requires preserving license and copyright notices (and NOTICE attributions) in any distribution
apache.org
, ensuring the original authors receive credit. Unlike MIT, it even mandates indicating significant changes
fossa.com
.

Liability protection: Like MIT/GPL, it disclaims all warranties and limits liability
apache.org
. It also explicitly forbids use of the ASF’s trademarks
apache.org
 (protecting authors’ identity).

Flexibility: Contributors may later dual-license portions or accept contributions under other compatible licenses if desired. Apache 2.0’s compatibility (even with GPLv3) allows mixing with many open projects.

Global enforceability: As an established open-source license created by the ASF (US) and approved by the OSI, Apache 2.0 has been used worldwide and has no choice-of-law quirks. Its clear language (unlike ad-hoc licenses) aids international courts or IP offices if enforcement were needed.

FSF notes that for “substantial programs” where patents matter, Apache 2.0 is preferable over BSD/MIT precisely because it “prevents patent treachery.”
gnu.org
. Combined with its permissive reuse, Apache 2.0 aligns well with all five criteria: strong IP safeguards and open usability.

 

Implications of Apache 2.0 for Crown Crypto: Using Apache 2.0 means the protocol and its smart-contract code can be freely used and extended by others, including in closed-source products, as long as original notices are kept
apache.org
. Contributors must agree to license their patents (if any) under the Apache terms
apache.org
. No fees or special permissions are required. Anyone redistributing modified code must highlight changes
fossa.com
 but may attach different licenses to their own contributions (except they must still comply with Apache for the Apache‑licensed portions). All users remain legally responsible for their own use and cannot hold the original authors liable
apache.org
. Overall, Apache 2.0 provides a clear, operational framework: it maximizes reuse while ensuring credit and patent peace.
